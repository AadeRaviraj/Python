# 2: Write a Python program to implement a class named BankAccount with the following requirements:
# The class should contain two instance variables:
# 0
# Name (Account holder name)
# Amount (Account balance)
# The class should contain one class variable:
# 0 ROI (Rate of Interest), initialized to 10.5
# Define a constructor (_init ) that accepts Name and initial Amount.
# Implement the following instance methods:
# Display()- displays account holder name and current balance
# Deposit() accepts an amount from the user and adds it to balance
# 0 Withdraw() accepts an amount from the user and subtracts it from balance (Ensure withdrawal is allowed only if sufficient balance exists)
# CalculateInterest() calculates and returns interest using formula: Interest = (Amount ROI) / 100
# Create multiple objects and demonstrate all methods.
